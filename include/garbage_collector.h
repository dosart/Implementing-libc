 * @brief Garbage collector.
 *
 * The garbage collector treats memory as a directed reachability graph.
 * The graph nodes are divided into a set of root nodes and a set of dynamic memory nodes.
 * Each dynamic memory node corresponds to an allocated dynamic memory block. A directed edge p â†’ q means that some cell in block p refers to some cell in block q.
 * Root nodes correspond to cells outside of the heap that refer to cells in the heap.
 * Such cells can be registers, variables on the stack, or global variables in the data segment in virtual memory.
